# Network-Analysis
# 🕸️ Network Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project performs **network analysis of communication patterns** using graph theory.  
It uncovers **hidden structures, influential actors, and community clusters** in complex networks.  

Built with **Streamlit**, it provides an interactive dashboard for exploring communication data and visualizing networks.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Upload or use sample dataset (`comms.csv`)  
✅ Compute **network centrality metrics**:
- **Degree Centrality** → Most connected actors  
- **Betweenness Centrality** → Information brokers / couriers  
- **Closeness Centrality** → Fastest spreaders  
✅ Perform **Community Detection** (clusters of tightly connected nodes)  
✅ Visualize the network graph with:
- Node size = centrality importance  
- Node color = community group
